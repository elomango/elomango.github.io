### Strengths ✅
1. **Record Defense Budget**: **U.S. DoD FY2025 budget request reached approx. $849.8B**, and the enacted budget stance remains robust, ensuring long-term revenue visibility.
2. **GE Aerospace Dominance**: Portfolio growth potential strengthened by the increasing weight (~20%) of GE Aerospace, which holds a monopolistic position in the aircraft engine sector.
3. **Geopolitical Hedge**: Serves to enhance portfolio resilience during global conflicts.

### Risks ⚠️
1. **Policy Dependency**: U.S. defense budgets may fluctuate based on political consensus and the final enactment process during administration changes.
2. **High Concentration**: Top 2 holdings (GE, RTX) exceed 36% weight, making the fund highly sensitive to individual company issues.

### Investment Rating: **BUY**

**Rationale**:
- As evidenced by the record performance in 2025 (48.66%), the defense sector has entered a **structural growth phase**.
- The expansion of weights in high-growth, high-margin companies like GE Aerospace is positive.
- Expanding defense budgets by the U.S. and allies, along with record commercial aircraft backlogs, will support future profitability.
