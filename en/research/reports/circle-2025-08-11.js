## Executive Summary

Circle Internet Group (NYSE: **CRCL**) is the world's second-largest stablecoin USDC issuer that successfully went public on the New York Stock Exchange in June 2025. As of August 2025, the stock trades in the $164-192 range with a market capitalization of approximately $37-40 billion.

Circle's business model is extremely dependent on **US Treasury bill interest income from USDC reserves** (99% of total revenue), with approximately $65.3 billion worth of USDC currently in circulation. In 2024, the company recorded $1.68 billion in revenue and $156 million in net income, though actual margins are limited due to revenue-sharing agreements with Coinbase.

The **GENIUS Act** passed in July 2025 is expected to provide Circle with a clear regulatory framework and facilitate institutional investor adoption. **Base case target price is $280-320** (75-95% upside potential), with bull case scenarios reaching $400-500.

## Financial Structure Analysis

### Asset Formation Method and Treasury Bill Holdings

Circle's asset structure is very conservative and transparent:

- **Total Assets Under Management**: $65.3 billion (equal to USDC circulation)
- **Asset Composition**:
  - **80%**: Circle Reserve Fund (USDXX) - SEC-registered government money market fund
  - **20%**: Cash at Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs)
- **Fund Manager**: BlackRock Advisors
- **Custodian Bank**: Bank of New York Mellon

*_Treasury Bills and Interest Rates_*
Treasury Bills are short-term securities issued by the US government with maturities of one year or less. They are considered risk-free assets and are directly influenced by Federal Reserve interest rate policy. When the Fed funds rate is at 4.5-5%, Treasury bill yields maintain similar levels. Circle invests USDC reserves in these Treasury bills, generating annual returns of 4.2-4.5%.

### USDC Reserve Composition and Management

**Reserve Transparency**:
- **100% Collateralized**: All USDC is backed 1:1 by US dollar assets
- **Monthly Audits**: Independent attestation reports by Grant Thornton LLP
- **Daily Reporting**: Circle Reserve Fund holdings disclosed through BlackRock
- **Average Maturity**: Only ultra-short assets with less than 90-day maturity

## Business Structure Deep Dive

### Core Revenue Model - Correlation with Short-term Interest Rates

Circle's revenue structure is extremely simple yet high-risk:

**Revenue Composition (2024 basis)**:
- **Reserve Interest Income**: $1.6 billion (99% of total revenue)
- **Other Service Revenue**: $0.017 billion (less than 1%)

**Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis**:
- **1% Rate Increase**: Annual revenue increases by $441 million
- **1% Rate Decrease**: Annual revenue decreases by $441 million
- **Break-even Rate**: Approximately 2.5-3% (turns unprofitable below this level)

*_Fed Rate and Circle Revenue Relationship_*
When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, Treasury bill yields rise accordingly. Since Circle invests $65.3 billion in USDC reserves in Treasury bills, a 1% rate increase generates $6.53 billion in additional annual revenue. However, about 50% is shared with Coinbase, so Circle's actual additional revenue is approximately $3.27 billion.

### Correlation with Cryptocurrency Markets

**Bitcoin Price and USDC Demand Relationship**:

Circle's growth is closely tied to the overall cryptocurrency market:

- **Bull Markets**: Increased trading volume drives USDC demand surge
- **Bear Markets**: Safe asset preference increases USDC holdings
- **Increased Volatility**: Higher stablecoin trading volumes

**Investment Grade**: Buy (Medium Risk)
**12-month Target Price**: $280-320
**24-month Target Price**: $400-500

However, extremely high interest rate sensitivity and Coinbase dependency remain risk factors requiring continuous monitoring. We recommend diversified investment at 3-7% portfolio allocation level.
