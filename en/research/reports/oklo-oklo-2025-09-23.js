## A Next-Generation Nuclear Company with Dramatic Growth and High Risk

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) is a next-generation nuclear company whose stock has surged over 1,500% year-to-date as of September 2025, breaking through a market capitalization of $20 billion. However, as a development-stage company with zero revenue to date, the current stock price reflects extreme optimism about future potential. While the explosive growth in AI datacenter power demand and strong U.S. government support for nuclear energy are the main drivers of the stock surge, execution risk remains very high with commercial operations not scheduled until late 2027. Investors must carefully weigh the innovative technology and massive market opportunity against high regulatory and technical uncertainties.

## 1. Company Overview

### Listing Information and Basic Status
- **Exchange**: New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
- **Ticker Symbol**: OKLO
- **Listing Date**: May 10, 2024 (Listed through SPAC merger)
- **Market Capitalization**: Approximately $20 billion (as of September 2025)
- **Headquarters**: Santa Clara, California (3190 Coronado Drive, Santa Clara, CA)
- **Founded**: 2013
- **Number of Employees**: 201

### Management Team Composition
CEO and co-founder Jacob DeWitte holds a PhD in Nuclear Engineering from MIT and has over 15 years of experience in the nuclear sector. In April 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stepped down as Chairman to avoid conflicts of interest, with DeWitte assuming the dual role of CEO and Chairman. COO Caroline Cochran (co-founder), CFO Craig Bealmear, and CTO Pat Schweiger (over 40 years of energy sector experience) comprise the core management team.

## 2. Business Model

### Core Business Model: Build-Own-Operate Power Sales
Unlike traditional reactor design sales approaches, Oklo has adopted a unique business model where they build, own, and operate reactors directly, selling only power through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). Customers purchase only clean electricity through 20-40 year long-term contracts without capital investment or operational complexity. This structure enables recurring revenue generation and is expected to achieve profitability from the first year.

### Products and Services
**Aurora Powerhouse**: A small modular reactor (SMR) using liquid metal-cooled fast neutron reactor technology, scalable from 15-100MW capacity. It can operate for over 10 years without refueling and features inherent safety through natural cooling. Its flexibility allows it to use either fresh HALEU fuel or recycled nuclear waste as fuel.

**Nuclear Fuel Recycling**: Pursuing construction of a $1.68 billion nuclear fuel recycling facility in Tennessee, planning to establish a vertically integrated fuel supply chain. This could recover over 90% of the energy from the 90,000+ tons of nuclear waste existing in the United States.

### Competitive Advantages
Technically, it possesses proven technology based on the EBR-II reactor design that operated successfully for 30 years. From a business perspective, integrated lifecycle management enables consistent management from design through operations, targeting 50-85% reduction in licensing timelines compared to traditional nuclear. The company presents a competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of $40-90/MWh.

### Customer Pipeline
As of September 2025, secured a total customer pipeline of 14GW, with the 12GW framework agreement with Switch being central. Contracts have been signed with Equinix (500MW), Wyoming Hyperscale (100MW), Diamondback Energy (50MW), and others, with AI datacenters accounting for over 600MW of the total pipeline.

## 3. Corporate Risk Analysis

### Regulatory Risk
In January 2022, the NRC denied Oklo's initial combined license application due to lack of technical information. Deficiencies were identified in Maximum Credible Accident (MCA) analysis, safety classification, and quality assurance programs. While passing the pre-application readiness assessment in July 2025, the overall approval timeline remains uncertain.

### Technical Risk
No Aurora reactor is currently in commercial operation, with the first commercial deployment scheduled for late 2027. HALEU fuel supply chain is the biggest bottleneck, with commercial-scale production currently only possible in Russia and China. U.S. domestic supply chain is not expected to be ready until the late 2020s.

### Market Risk
In fierce competition with numerous SMR developers including NuScale, GE Hitachi, and TerraPower. Declining renewable energy costs and advancing energy storage technology are weakening nuclear's traditional baseload advantages. The $14.1 billion order pipeline consists entirely of non-binding letters of intent, which is also a risk.

### Financial Risk
Burned $386 million in cash in 2024, expected to increase to $650-800 million in 2025. With $231 million in cash as of September 2025, approximately 7.5 years of runway is secured, but significant capital will be needed during the commercialization phase.

### Execution Risk
Management has limited public company operating experience and no commercial fast reactor construction experience. Nuclear construction projects have historically experienced severe delays and cost overruns.
