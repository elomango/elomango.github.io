4. **Solid Financial Structure**: Low net debt ratio, strong cash generation capability

### Final Investment Opinion
**Rating: Hold / Conditional Buy**

Vertiv is showing strong growth momentum as a core beneficiary of the AI data center boom, but the current stock price already reflects many positive factors. While it is an attractive investment target in the long term, there is valuation burden in the short term, so entry on corrections is recommended.
