## Executive Summary

**In an era of maximum geopolitical uncertainty, the defense sector has become the safest haven in the 'Age of Fear.'**

While global markets ride a rollercoaster of tariff wars, inflation resurgence concerns, and geopolitical tensions, Lockheed Martin has quietly accumulated a record-breaking backlog of $194 billion. This isn't just a number—it means years of future revenue already signed in contracts.

When markets fear, defense stocks shine. With a beta of 0.23, a stable 2.29% dividend yield, and the U.S. government as its most reliable customer, Lockheed Martin embodies the essence of 'defensive appeal' that investors seek in times of uncertainty.

## 2. Investment Appeal: Why Defense Stocks Now?

### Macroeconomic Defensive Power
**Safe Haven Role Amid Market Fear**

Global markets in 2024-2026 have experienced extreme volatility:
- U.S.-China trade tensions reigniting
- Supply chain risks from tariff uncertainty
- Inflation resurgence concerns

In this environment, Lockheed Martin's **beta of 0.23** means it reflects only 1/4 of market volatility. When the S&P 500 drops 10%, LMT is affected by an average of only 2.3%.

### Backlog: A Business with Guaranteed Future

**$194 billion backlog is 2.6x current annual revenue ($75 billion)**

What this means:
- Can maintain current revenue levels for 2.5+ years with zero new orders
- Long-term contracts ensure stability even in recession
- Backlog continues growing with allied nation expansion

### Dividend Stability

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual Dividend | $13.80/share |
| Dividend Yield | 2.29% |
| Dividend Growth | 21 consecutive years of increases |
| Payout Ratio | ~42% |

Lockheed Martin has **raised dividends for 21 consecutive years**, qualifying for Dividend Aristocrat status. Based on stable cash flows, dividend reliability is exceptionally high.
