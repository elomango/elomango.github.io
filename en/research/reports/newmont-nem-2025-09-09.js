## Investment Value Assessment of the World's Largest Gold Producer

Newmont Corporation currently trades at $57.90 per share, with a **P/E ratio of 13.2x**, half the industry average, indicating an undervalued state. As of September 2025, with gold prices reaching a record high of $3,650 per ounce, the company achieved a record quarterly free cash flow of **$1.6 billion**. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan forecast gold prices to reach $3,700-4,000 by 2026, and Newmont's low production cost (AISC $1,620/oz) provides a **margin of $2,000 per ounce** at current gold prices. However, four fatalities in 2024 and a lawsuit from a former safety executive represent significant risk factors.

## Listing Markets and Business Model

Newmont is the only gold producer in the S&P 500 index, listed on **NYSE (NEM)**, TSX (NGT), ASX (NEM), and PNGX (NEM). Founded in 1916 and headquartered in Denver, Colorado, the company has grown into a global enterprise operating mines in 13 countries.

The company's core assets are distributed across four continents: North America (Nevada, Colorado, Canada, Mexico), South America (Peru, Suriname, Argentina), Australia (Boddington, Tanami, Lihir), and Africa (Ghana). In 2024, it produced **6.8 million ounces of gold**, along with by-products of 153,000 tons of copper and 45.6 million ounces of silver. Its gold reserves of **134.1 million ounces** are the world's largest, exceeding the combined reserves of competitors Barrick Gold (77 million ounces) and Agnico Eagle (53.8 million ounces).

The **$19.2 billion Newcrest acquisition** completed in November 2023 was the company's largest transaction in history, solidifying its position as the world's largest gold producer. Following the acquisition, a **$4.3 billion non-core asset divestiture program** is underway, with $2.5 billion in net cash inflows expected by the first half of 2025.

## Diversified Risk Profile

Newmont faces operational, market, regulatory, and geopolitical risks, with several risks materializing recently. **Four fatalities in 2024** ended a five-year safety streak, and former safety executive Rebecca Perrett filed a lawsuit claiming the company sacrificed safety for profitability. In July 2024, three contract workers were trapped underground for over 60 hours at the Red Chris mine.

The **four-month strike at Mexico's Peñasquito mine (June-October 2023)** resulted in daily losses of $3.7 million and a 72% reduction in gold production. Currency risk is substantial, with operations in 13 countries exposing the company to Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Mexican pesos, Peruvian soles, Ghanaian cedis, and other currencies. Enhanced water quality regulations at Peru's Yanacocha mine resulted in **$1.131 billion in additional restoration costs**, while rising resource nationalism in Panama has raised industry-wide concerns.

Climate change-induced extreme weather events are also impacting operations. In 2023, the Tanami mine experienced major flooding, while the Éléonore mine faced production disruptions from wildfires. Supply chain issues persist, with extended lead times for mining equipment and shortages of specialized parts increasing operating costs.

## Record 2024 Financial Performance and 2025 Outlook

In 2024, Newmont recorded **revenue of $18.7 billion** (58% increase year-over-year), **net income of $3.3 billion** (234% increase), and **adjusted EBITDA of $8.7 billion** (106% increase). The fourth quarter achieved a quarterly record free cash flow of **$1.6 billion**, with average realized gold price of $2,408 per ounce, up 23% year-over-year.

Quarterly performance in 2024 showed net income surging from $170 million in Q1 to $1.4 billion in Q4, with AISC at $1,516 per ounce, below the industry average of $1,680. **Debt ratio stands at 28%**, demonstrating financial health, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 0.6x, indicating strong financial stability.

For 2025, the company targets gold production of 5.9 million ounces with AISC of $1,630 per ounce. Plans include $1.8 billion in sustaining capital expenditures for the Tier 1 portfolio, $1.3 billion in development capital expenditures, and $525 million for exploration and new projects. Ghana's Ahafo North mine is expected to begin commercial production in the second half of 2025, adding 275,000-325,000 ounces annually.

## Undervalued Valuation and Positive Analyst Outlook

Newmont's current **P/E ratio of 13.2x** is half the industry average of 26.8x, and its EV/EBITDA of 6.8-7.1x is attractive relative to peers. Despite a market capitalization of $64.4 billion as the world's largest gold producer, it trades at lower multiples than Agnico Eagle (P/E 28.9x) or Barrick Gold (15.3x).

Analysts' average price targets range from **$54-74**, with highest targets reaching $87-104. Among all analysts, 42-52% recommend strong buy, 27% recommend buy, with no sell recommendations. In April 2025, UBS raised its target from $54 to $60, while National Bank Financial assigned an outperform rating with an $80.16 target.

The stock rose 50% in 2024, outperforming gold prices (34% increase), and is up 15% year-to-date in 2025. With a dividend yield of 1.72-1.79%, paying annual dividends of $1.00 per share, the company returned $2.4 billion to shareholders in 2024 through **$1.2 billion in share buybacks** and **$1.1 billion in dividends**.

## Maximizing Benefits in the $3,650 Gold Era

As of September 2025, gold prices are at a record high of **$3,650 per ounce**, with Goldman Sachs forecasting $3,700 by end-2025 and JP Morgan projecting $4,000 by Q2 2026. Extreme scenarios suggest potential rises to $4,500 by end-2025 and $6,000 by 2029.

Newmont maintains a **no-hedging policy since 2007**, capturing 100% of gold price upside. A $100 increase in gold price generates $517 million in annual revenue and $120 million in quarterly EBITDA, with 75-80% of revenue increases flowing through to operating cash flow, demonstrating high operating leverage.

Current AISC of $1,620 versus gold price of $3,650 provides a **margin exceeding $2,000 per ounce**, industry-leading levels. Central bank gold purchases of 1,086 tons in 2024 and 244 tons in Q1 2025 support demand, while North American ETF inflows of $21 billion in H1 2025 indicate strong investment demand.

## Recent M&A Activity and Portfolio Optimization

The **Newcrest acquisition ($19.2 billion)** completed in November 2023 established Newmont as the undisputed world's largest gold producer. Post-acquisition portfolio optimization through non-core asset divestments is progressing, with **$4.3 billion in divestitures** exceeding the initial $2 billion target.

Key divestitures include Telfer & Havieron ($475 million), Éléonore ($795 million), Cripple Creek ($275 million), Musselwhite ($850 million), Porcupine ($425 million), and Akyem ($1 billion, expected H1 2025 completion). Proceeds are being used for debt reduction and shareholder returns, with early redemption of $928 million in 2026 maturity bonds in February 2025.

New development projects include Ghana's Ahafo North (production start H2 2025), Australia's Tanami Expansion 2 (commercial production 2027), and Australia's Cadia Panel Cave 2-3. In renewable energy, the Wheatstone Wind Farm project for Australia's Boddington mine targets 900,000 tons of annual CO2 reduction.

## ESG Assessment and Sustainability Challenges

Newmont is a 9-year consecutive leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index mining sector and was named the only mining company among Time's **World's 100 Most Sustainable Companies** in 2024 (84th place). Sustainalytics ESG risk rating is 21.4 (medium risk), ranking 12th among 118 precious metals companies.

Environmental targets include 30% reduction in Scope 1&2 greenhouse gases by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050. The company signed a $100 million partnership with Caterpillar for autonomous electric mining equipment and restored 192 hectares of land in 2024, exceeding the 162-hectare target.

However, **four fatalities in 2024** represent serious concerns. Accidents in Ghana, Argentina, and Canada ended a five-year safety streak, and a former safety executive filed a lawsuit claiming the company sacrificed safety for profitability. Cyanide spill incidents totaled 30 in 2024, down 33% year-over-year but still requiring improvement.

For social responsibility, the company spent $2.6 billion with local suppliers in 2024 and invested $69 million in community projects. For Indigenous community relations, the company adheres to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) principles, committing not to proceed with Saddle North or Red Chris projects without Tahltan Nation consent.

## Investment Advice and Key Considerations

Newmont offers an **attractive investment opportunity** in the current gold price environment. A valuation 50% below peers, industry-lowest production costs, and world's largest gold reserves represent compelling investment points. If gold prices remain at $3,650, 2025 free cash flow exceeding $5 billion is expected, representing 8% of market capitalization.

**Key opportunity factors** include 100% revenue exposure to gold price increases, financial structure improvement through $4.3 billion asset sales, Tier 1 asset portfolio focus, and Federal Reserve rate cut cycle entry. Central banks' continued gold purchases and geopolitical uncertainties are expected to support gold prices.

**Core risk factors** include regulatory sanctions and reputational damage if safety improvements fail, political instability in key operating countries, high sensitivity to gold price declines, and execution risks in Newcrest integration. The 2024 fatalities and related litigation may negatively impact stock price in the short term.

Investors should consider this as a **core holding** to maximize benefits from the gold price upcycle from a long-term perspective. However, close monitoring of safety performance improvements and portfolio diversification against gold price volatility are necessary. At current price levels, risk-reward is favorable, with significant upside potential particularly if gold prices move toward $4,000.`;
