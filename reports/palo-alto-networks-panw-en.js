    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 style="color: #ff6b35; margin-bottom: 15px;">5. Short-term Investment Outlook (6 months - 1 year)</h2>
        
        <h3><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Technical Analysis and Momentum</strong></h3>
        <p>Current stock price trades in the $177-199 range, with <strong style="color: #ff6b35;">RSI 36.5-58.71 in neutral to slightly oversold territory</strong>. Trading above 50-day and 200-day moving averages shows bullish signals, but short-term volatility is expected due to concerns over high valuation.</p>

        <p><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Key support levels are $158-160 and $170</strong>, with resistance at $185, $195, and $204. Trading volume increased and liquidity improved following the 2:1 stock split implemented on December 16, 2024.</p>

        <h3><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Short-term Catalysts and Risks</strong></h3>
        <p><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Positive catalysts</strong> include continued high growth in Next-Generation Security ARR at Q3 earnings, Cortex XSIAM customer expansion, and accelerated AI security platform adoption. Additional $500 million share buyback authorization is also a stock price support factor.</p>

        <p><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Short-term risks</strong> include intensified competition from Google's Wiz acquisition ($32 billion), CrowdStrike's aggressive market expansion, and burden from high valuation (P/E 94-117x). Possibility of IT spending slowdown due to macroeconomic uncertainty is also a variable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 style="color: #ff6b35; margin-bottom: 15px;">6. Long-term Investment Outlook (3-5 years)</h2>
        
        <h3><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Structural Growth Drivers</strong></h3>
        <p>The cybersecurity market's <strong style="color: #ff6b35;">9.7-12.6% annual growth</strong> supports Palo Alto Networks' long-term growth. Increasing AI-based threats are driving explosive demand for AI security solutions, while digital transformation and cloud migration provide continuous demand creation factors.</p>

        <p><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Platform integration trends</strong> work favorably for Palo Alto Networks.

    <div class="section">
        <h2 style="color: #ff6b35; margin-bottom: 15px;">7. Analyst Opinions and Price Targets</h2>
        
        <h3><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Consensus Outlook</strong></h3>
        <p><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">89.3% of 54 analysts provide buy recommendations</strong>, with average price target of $210-217, indicating 20-25% upside potential from current levels. Goldman Sachs raised its price target to $231, while Morgan Stanley maintains overweight rating.</p>

        <p>Recent upgrades from Piper Sandler and Deutsche Bank from neutral to buy reflect continued positive rating changes. Analysts rate Palo Alto Networks alongside CrowdStrike and Microsoft as <strong style="color: #ff6b35;">one of the three leaders driving cybersecurity consolidation</strong>.</p>

        <h3><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Bull Case vs Bear Case</strong></h3>
        <p><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Bull Case (price target $240+)</strong> emphasizes potential to become "Microsoft of cybersecurity." Key factors include AI security leader advantage, strategic M&A capability leveraging over $3 billion annual FCF, market expansion potential with only 4% penetration of $110 billion TAM, and possibility of achieving 30%+ operating margin through operational efficiency improvements.</p>

        <p><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Bear Case (price target $130-150)</strong> concerns excessive valuation. Forward P/E over 42x is excessive compared to industry average, threats from Wiz-Google combination and CrowdStrike are growing, complexity of integrating 17+ acquired companies, and revenue growth rate slowing from 50%+ to mid-teens are risk factors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 style="color: #ff6b35; margin-bottom: 15px;">8. Investment Considerations</h2>
        
        <h3><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Valuation Levels</strong></h3>
        <p>Currently trading at <strong style="color: #ff6b35;">P/E 94-117x, P/S 17.11x, EV/Sales 12.5x</strong>, significantly higher premium compared to industry average. This reflects high growth expectations but implies potential for sharp correction if performance disappoints.</p>

        <p>PEG ratio of 2.29 suggests somewhat overvaluation relative to growth rate. However, considering high FCF margin of 37-38% and strong competitive advantages, the premium may be partially justified.</p>

        <h3><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Key Risk Factors</strong></h3>
        <p><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Competition risk</strong> is the biggest concern. Google's Wiz acquisition is intensifying cloud security competition, with threats from CrowdStrike's endpoint market expansion and Microsoft's bundling strategy.</p>

        <div class="info-box" style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #ff6b35; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
            <p><em><strong>Technology change risks</strong> also exist. Potential threats include quantum computing rendering current encryption methods obsolete, risk of falling behind in AI arms race, and market transition to agentless solutions.</em></p>
        </div>

        <h3><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Overall Investment Attractiveness Assessment</strong></h3>
        <p>Palo Alto Networks offers <strong style="color: #ff6b35;">attractive investment opportunity for long-term growth investors</strong>. Positive factors include structural cybersecurity market growth, AI security leadership, platformization strategy success, and strong financial foundation.</p>

        <p>While short-term volatility is expected due to high valuation and intensified competition, we present <strong style="color: #ff6b35;">buy opinion from a 3-5 year investment perspective</strong>. Price target is $225-235, expecting 15-20% annual returns. However, we recommend limiting portfolio weight to within 10% and using dollar-cost averaging strategy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h2 style="color: #ff6b35; margin-bottom: 15px;">Conclusion</h2>
        <p><strong style="color: #ff6b35;">Palo Alto Networks</strong> is a leading company driving platform integration and AI innovation at the inflection point of the cybersecurity industry. The <strong style="color: #ff6b35;">$25 billion CyberArk acquisition</strong> demonstrates the company's ambitious vision and execution capability, while 37% growth in Next-Generation Security ARR proves successful business transformation.</p>

        <p>Despite burden from high valuation, considering <strong style="color: #ff6b35;">annual FCF generation capability of over $3 billion and market opportunity with only 4% penetration of $110 billion TAM</strong>, long-term growth potential is sufficient. Continuous increase in cyber threats and accelerated digital transformation provide structural growth drivers, while AI security field leadership ensures differentiated competitive advantage.</p>

        <p>Investors who can tolerate short-term volatility will be able to secure quality exposure to the rapidly growing cybersecurity market through Palo Alto Networks.</p>
