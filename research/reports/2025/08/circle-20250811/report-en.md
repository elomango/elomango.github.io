## In-depth Business Structure Analysis

### Core Revenue Model - Correlation with Treasury Rates

Circle's revenue structure is extremely simple yet high-risk:

**Revenue Composition (2024)**:
- **Reserve Interest Income**: $1.6 billion (99% of total revenue)
- **Other Service Revenue**: $17 million (less than 1%)

**Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis**:
- **1% Rate Increase**: $441 million annual revenue increase
- **1% Rate Decrease**: $441 million annual revenue decrease
- **Break-even Rate**: Approximately 2.5-3% (below this level, the company turns unprofitable)

### Correlation with Cryptocurrency Markets

**Bitcoin Price and USDC Demand Relationship**:

Circle's growth is closely tied to the overall cryptocurrency market:

- **Bull Market**: Increased trading volume drives USDC demand surge
- **Bear Market**: Safe-haven preference increases USDC holdings
- **Increased Volatility**: Higher stablecoin trading volume

**Market Share Status**:
- **Tether (USDT)**: $158.5 billion (65% market share) - Asia/emerging markets leader
- **Circle (USDC)**: $65.3 billion (25% market share) - North America/institutional markets leader

### Revenue Sharing Structure with Coinbase

One of Circle's biggest weaknesses is its **revenue-sharing agreement with Coinbase**:

- **Distribution Ratio**: Approximately 50-56% of residual USDC reserve income paid to Coinbase
- **2024 Payments**: About $1.01 billion (out of $1.7 billion total revenue)
- **Actual Margin**: Circle retains only about 44-50% of total revenue

### Key Risks

1. **Interest Rate Dependency**: 99% of revenue dependent on Treasury interest
2. **Partner Dependency**: High revenue-sharing ratio with Coinbase

## Conclusion and Investment Opinion

Circle (CRCL) is the **primary beneficiary of improved regulatory environment and crypto market growth**. The passage of the GENIUS Act significantly lowers barriers for institutional investor entry, with explosive growth expected in the stablecoin market.

**Investment Rating**: Buy (Medium Risk)
**12-Month Target Price**: $280-320
**24-Month Target Price**: $400-500

However, extremely high interest rate sensitivity and Coinbase dependency are risk factors requiring continuous monitoring. We recommend diversified investment at 3-7% of portfolio allocation.
