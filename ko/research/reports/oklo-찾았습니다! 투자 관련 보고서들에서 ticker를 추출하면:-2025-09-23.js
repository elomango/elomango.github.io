## Current conditions show warm, humid weather with afternoon storm potential

Seoul is experiencing typical late summer conditions today with **temperatures reaching 30-32°C (86-90°F)** and partly to mostly cloudy skies. The current temperature stands at approximately 30°C (86°F) with humidity levels between 70-80%, creating a muggy feel throughout the metropolitan area. Today marks the transition period as Seoul moves from its monsoon season toward more stable autumn weather patterns.

The high humidity combined with warm temperatures creates conditions favorable for afternoon and evening thunderstorm development. Weather models indicate a **70-80% chance of scattered showers and thunderstorms**, particularly during evening hours. These storms are expected to bring light to moderate rainfall, providing some relief from the day's heat and humidity.

## Atmospheric conditions and sun exposure

### Wind and pressure patterns
Current wind conditions remain relatively calm with speeds of **10-15 km/h (6-9 mph) from the south-southwest**, occasionally gusting up to 20 km/h (12 mph). These southerly winds continue to transport warm, moist air from the East China Sea region, maintaining the humid conditions across the Korean Peninsula.

### Solar radiation and UV safety
The UV index reaches **6-8 (High)** during peak daylight hours despite cloud cover. Sun protection remains essential, particularly between 11 AM and 3 PM. Residents and visitors should apply SPF 30+ sunscreen, wear protective clothing and UV-blocking sunglasses, and seek shade during midday hours to prevent overexposure.

Today's daylight spans **12 hours and 47 minutes**, with sunrise occurring at **6:06 AM KST** and sunset at **6:54 PM KST**. Solar noon peaks at 12:30 PM when the sun reaches its highest point at approximately 58 degrees above the horizon.

## Air quality remains moderate across metropolitan Seoul

The Air Quality Index (AQI) currently reads **50-59**, placing conditions in the Moderate category. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) measures **8-10 µg/m³**, while coarser particles (PM10) register **19-30 µg/m³**. These levels indicate generally acceptable air quality for most residents, though sensitive individuals including children, elderly, and those with respiratory conditions may experience minor symptoms during extended outdoor activities.

The moderate air quality results from a combination of local vehicle emissions, industrial activity, and transboundary pollution typical for Seoul during late summer. The expected evening precipitation should help clear some particulates from the atmosphere, potentially improving conditions overnight.

## Hourly progression and precipitation timing

Morning hours from 6 AM to noon feature partly cloudy skies with temperatures climbing steadily from the overnight low of **24°C (75°F)** toward the day's peak. Cloud cover increases through midday as atmospheric instability builds.

The afternoon period between noon and 6 PM brings peak temperatures of **30-32°C (86-90°F)** with increasing cloudiness. Scattered cumulus clouds develop into more organized storm systems as heating maximizes surface instability. The combination of high temperatures and humidity creates a heat index approaching 35°C (95°F).

Evening hours after 6 PM show the highest probability for thunderstorm activity. Temperatures gradually decrease toward the overnight low of **23-24°C (73-75°F)** as storm systems move through the region. Rainfall amounts remain light to moderate, typically measuring 5-15mm where storms develop.

## Three-day forecast indicates gradual cooling trend

**September 7 (Sunday)** brings slightly cooler conditions with a high of **28°C (82°F)** and low of **20°C (68°F)**. Morning showers remain possible with a 15-20% precipitation chance before skies become mostly cloudy for the afternoon. The cooling trend signals the approaching autumn season as high pressure begins building from the north.

**September 8 (Monday)** maintains similar temperatures with highs near **28-30°C (82-86°F)** and lows around **20-21°C (68-70°F)**. Cloudy skies dominate with only a 14% chance of precipitation, marking a drier pattern as the subtropical high pressure system weakens its influence over the Korean Peninsula.

**September 9 (Tuesday)** features a 47% chance of morning showers before conditions improve to partly cloudy. Temperatures reach **30°C (86°F)** during afternoon hours before dropping to a noticeably cooler **17-19°C (63-66°F)** overnight. This larger diurnal temperature range indicates drier air masses moving into the region.

## Conclusion

Today's weather in Seoul presents typical late summer conditions with warm temperatures, high humidity, and afternoon thunderstorm potential requiring both sun protection and rain preparedness. The moderate air quality and calm wind conditions create generally favorable circumstances for outdoor activities during morning hours, though afternoon plans should account for likely precipitation. The three-day outlook suggests a gradual transition toward more comfortable autumn weather with decreasing humidity and more stable atmospheric conditions developing early next week.`
